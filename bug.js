This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that have a key prop that is not unique. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering of items, incorrect item positioning, and unexpected behavior with FlatList's internal state management.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, the `keyExtractor` function uses the `id` property, but the data contains duplicate `id` values (1). This will cause issues. 

The error can be subtle and may not always lead to a clear error message from React Native.  Symptoms include items appearing in the wrong order, items disappearing, or rendering errors.
